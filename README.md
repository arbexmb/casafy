# Casafy - Front-end test

This repository contains an application design for the requested project in the CASAFY - TESTE FRONT END, better described [here](https://github.com/properati-llc/teste_frontend).

## Introduction

The application was developed using Vue.js alongside with Nuxt.js as front-end frameworks, and Tailwind as the css framework.

As requested, casafy's search page was recreated in this application, with a few of its functionalities, such as realty cards as separated components, an embedded google map with pins on it, a button to toggle the map, and more.

**OBS:** Before digging into the code, it is important to emphasise that I am, mainly, a back-end programmer, with experience in Node.js, PHP, and more. Nonetheless, I have been working with front-end my entire career, and thus, I have tried to show my skills with it in this project.

## Setup

It is very simple to setup this project to run it locally. After cloning this repository, you can simply run the following commands to run the application:

```bash
# to install dependencies:
$ npm install

# to serve the application with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

That is it!

Once you have done that, the application will be running on port 3000, and it will be accessible at: http://localhost:3000/

**OBS:** It is needless to say that it is necessary to have Node.js and npm installed locally. And, of course, port 3000 must be free in order to use it.

## Heroku

To make it easier to see the application in a running state, and also to check its responsiveness, I have also deployed the application on heroku, which it is easily accessible through this url: https://arbexmb-casafy.herokuapp.com/

## Conclusion

I hope I have covered everything that was requested, and I also hope that this project is enough to show my skills, considering, as I said in the introduction, that front-end is not my main area of expertise.

However, if anything is missing, I am willing to work even further on the application.
